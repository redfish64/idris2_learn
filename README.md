Just some example code I've been playing with over the last year or so.

Not well documented, but has a lot of neat little examples of what happens when you use
various idris syntax. 

Also has a couple examples exploring `elab-util' and `lens' for idris2.

Just thought might be useful for some people to mess with. 

pull requests greatly appreciated!
